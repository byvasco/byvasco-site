I’m a designer and developer, creating things for the web from Lisbon, Portugal.

During the day I’m at [Hole19 Golf](https://hole19golf.com) helping to build a platform and tools for golfers, during the night I’m having fun creating an old Volkswagen [community](https://mk2swag.com), coding, and doing some other cool projects.
