I‚Äôve been somewhat thoughtful and slightly overthinking the topic of creating content, and building a personal brand for myself.

First of all, why even bother creating a personal brand? In my opinion is one of the greatest assets we can have, specially for the work side of our lives. My motivation is to be able to connect with people from all over the world, to create future opportunities, and to do something that is actually valuable or help someone.

Now, this last part ‚Äì giving value ‚Äì is what have been bothering me for quite some time. Because what do I know, right? I‚Äôm currently 22, and even though I‚Äôve been working as a designer and a developer since I was 17, I really don‚Äôt think I have something special, or some special knowledge to give to people. So ok, I can‚Äôt go through that route.

There‚Äôs this **document, don‚Äôt create** concept GaryVee came up with, and if you follow his work like me, you‚Äôre most likely aware of what I‚Äôm talking about. If you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs basically this: we should document what we‚Äôre doing, and position ourselves not like an expert on something (if we‚Äôre not), but rather as someone who is trying to become something. So we should document our process on becoming a web designer, on becoming a developer, or a writer, or a racing driver, or whatever we want to become.

Now, I love that, because it alleviates me from not feeling accredited to give advice, I can just document what I‚Äôm doing and just give my opinions. However, I still couldn‚Äôt understand how that could possibly bring value to somebody, because at the end of the day I‚Äôd be just constantly talking about myself‚Ä¶ Until about 10 minutes ago!

I was on my lunch break, listening to Gary‚Äôs video ‚ÄúDocument, Don‚Äôt Create‚Äù for the 1000th time (üëÜüèº this one right here) and there‚Äôs a clip of him talking where he says this:

> ‚ÄúIf I actually, from where I started, go on to buy a 4B$ sports organization and I documented the entire journey‚Ä¶ My words are motivating and I‚Äôm good at that. But, the reason I do DailyVee and the reason I‚Äôm documenting so much is: if I can put out a body of work 40 years from now that showed the process of a young man that put in the work, had the vision, did it the right way, tried to help people along the way and then I actually accomplish it, well that becomes a real great American Dream story‚Äù.

And that got me thinking, because that‚Äôs the value I‚Äôm adding. Me and everyone else that‚Äôs documenting their journeys. We can be an inspiration for the future people that come after us. And  that can be in 40 years, on in 40 days.

Like [@thepatwalls](https://twitter.com/thepatwalls), [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio), or [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) : they‚Äôre doing their own stuff, documenting the process while doing it, and sharing with the world, which is quite inspiring!

So yeah, just a quick thought I wanted to put into words because I want to do this. I want to record the process of me trying to go where I want to go, and the things that I learn along the way.

Have a great day!
